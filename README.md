# Black-Mesa-Blue-Shift-Launcher
A simple launcher for Black Mesa: Blue Shift to launch through Steam.
Includes an optional variant with a Black Mesa inspired starting sequence

Feel free to distribute this wherever and to whomever you wish.
If modifying and distributing, credit me if and where possible.

Please note that in the names of the files, v2 denotes a version with the aforementioned starting sequence, while old_UI launches a version of Black Mesa: Blue Shift with a UI resembling that of the classic gold_src engine games.
